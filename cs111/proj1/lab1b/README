INCLUDED FILES 
----------------------------
lab1a.c: source module. it uses long opts to see if it needs to create a child
	shell process. The parent process is a character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal
	I/O and restores to nomral terminal on exit. If shell is specified, it creates a child shell 
	process which takes input from parent and runs the input in the shell and outputs
	to the parent which outputs to terminal. The parent can quit shell with predefined escape sequence
	^D for EOF and ^C to kill child process. The parent reading from stdin and from
	the shell is done with polling and if the shell process is killed, it will cause an error
	and close the parent process.
