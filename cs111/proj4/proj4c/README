lab4c_tcp.c: contains c source code that collects temperature readings from the Beaglebone and supports options for logging,

output through the socket, and receives commands through the socket.
lab4c_tls.c: contains c source code that achieves same functionality as lab4c_tcp.c, but uses tls encryption.
Makefile: to build and test your application
README: contains descriptions of each of the included files.
