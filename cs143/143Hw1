C If we cache the ride data, it will help reduce the load for the queries to the database. However, other apps will not have the updated info if they query the database and may get incorrect results. This may happen when a user activates a Bird but another user sees the Bird as offline even though it is online.
I would modify the row on activation and park since accurate data is more improtant that reducing the load. A better way would to be to use a callback. When we want to know if a Bird is active, we can request the Bird its status. If it is being used then we would reply with its correct status. Thus, we main
